Problem Statement:

Atliq Grands, a prominent player in India's hospitality industry, boasting multiple five-star hotels, faces a critical challenge. Over its 20-year tenure, the company has encountered a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotels sector. This downturn is primarily attributed to competitive maneuvers from rival entities coupled with ineffective decision-making at the management level.

In response to this decline, the managing director recognizes the urgent need for strategic intervention: the incorporation of "Business and Data Intelligence" to reclaim market share and revenue. However, Atliq Grands lacks an internal data analytics team capable of furnishing these crucial insights.

To address this imperative, the revenue management team has initiated plans to engage a third-party service provider. This provider will leverage historical data to extract insights essential for informing strategic decisions.
